# STUDIO-U 
## STUDIO-U is an application that allows creatives to connect to hosts in a manner somewhat similar to Air-BNB. The basis of this application was to provide movie scouts (professional and novice)  to have a place where they can come and view potential properties for use in their films. STUDIO-U is still true to it's original purpose however it is now open to creatives as whole and not just for movies. We host properties on our application to suit the needs of movies, tv shows, music videos, fashion shows, and photography shoots.
